## **Images**

In addition to <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/">Bootstrap</a>, a variety of other tools and resources were used in the development of the website. Pexels, Google and Amazon were used as sources for high-quality, partially royalty-free images that were used throughout the website. The images were then
  edited with the help of Croppola, an online image editing tool that allows you to crop and resize images and a compressor called Optimizilla.
  Ezgif was used to convert the images and, Upscale AI, was used to enhance the quality of the images.

## **Intro**
The website was designed and developed using <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/">Bootstrap</a>, a popular front-end framework developed and maintained by Twitter. 
<a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/">Bootstrap</a> provides a set of pre-designed CSS and JavaScript components that can be easily integrated into a website,
 which makes it easy to create a website that looks great on desktop and mobile devices. The website was also designed
  to be responsive and mobile-first, which means that it automatically adjusts the layout of a website to fit different screen sizes.Stack Overflow, an online community of developers that provides answers to programming questions, was also used as a resource for troubleshooting and solving development problems.

The website's design is based on a clean, modern aesthetic. The layout is simple and easy to navigate, with clear headings and
 sections that make it easy for users to find the information they need. The colour scheme is primarily black and white, with
  the occasional use of accent colours to highlight important elements.
### **The process included the following steps:** 
- Define the purpose and goals of the website
- Plan the website structure and content
- Design the layout, color scheme and user interface
- Develop and implement the website using HTML, CSS, and framework
- Test the website for functionality and usability
- Launch the website and perform ongoing maintenance and updates.

## **Challenges**
I encountered some problems during the advancement process.
The deployment on github diden't support the parrallax effect on the hero images, that would have been a catch for the design of the website.
Tried to solve it. After 16 commits to test it, I found that the best thing to do was to get rid of it and proceed with a normal scroll image. I was advised by my mentor about the unpredictability of this component, but i persisted over time, and failed.

## **Unsolved bugs**
- Resources are blocking the first paint of your page. Consider delivering critical JS/CSS inline and deferring all non-critical JS/styles
- Serve images that are appropriately-sized to save cellular data and improve load time.
- A long cache lifetime can speed up repeat visits to your page.
- Set an explicit width and height on image elements to reduce layout shifts and improve CLS.
- Some third-party embeds can be lazy loaded. Consider replacing them with a facade until they are required.
- Consider marking your touch and wheel event listeners as `passive` to improve your page's scroll performance.
- Avoid enormous network payloads.
- Some aria-labels where declared as warnings on the validator.
