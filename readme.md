The website was designed and developed using Bootstrap, a popular front-end framework developed and maintained by Twitter. 
Bootstrap provides a set of pre-designed CSS and JavaScript components that can be easily integrated into a website,
 which makes it easy to create a website that looks great on desktop and mobile devices. The website was also designed
  to be responsive and mobile-first, which means that it automatically adjusts the layout of a website to fit different screen sizes.

The website's design is based on a clean, modern aesthetic. The layout is simple and easy to navigate, with clear headings and
 sections that make it easy for users to find the information they need. The color scheme is primarily black and white, with
  the occasional use of accent colors to highlight important elements.

In addition to Bootstrap, a variety of other tools and resources were used in the development of the website. Pexels, Evolve MMA
 and Amazon were used as sources for high-quality, royalty-free images that were used throughout the website. The images were then
  edited with the help of Croppola, an online image editing tool that allows you to crop and resize images and a compressor called Optimizilla. And also Upscale AI, 
  was used to enhance the quality of the images. Google Fonts was used to add stylish typography to the website. Stack Overflow, 
  an online community of developers that provides answers to programming questions, was also used as a resource for troubleshooting 
  and solving development problems.

The website's design process started with the use of wireframe software Figma, which was used to create a visual representation of 
the website's layout and design. This allowed for a aproximative understanding of the website's structure and organization before moving on to the actual development process.

The website also includes a HTML and CSS formatter, HTMLFormatter and CleanCSS respectively, to keep the code neat and tidy. 
The website was also validated using W3C's HTML and CSS validator to ensure that it meets web standards.

The website was also designed to be easily accessible on mobile devices, it was tested on iPhone,
 this allowed us to ensure that the website was fully functional and responsive on mobile devices.

The logo of the website was also created using Freeform, this software was used to create a logo that represents the brand of 
the website, and adds an extra layer of professionalism and credibility to the website.

In summary, the website was designed and developed using a combination of different tools and resources such as Bootstrap, 
Pexels, Evolve MMA, Amazon, Croppola, Miro, Figma, Coolors, Upscale AI, Google Fonts, Stack Overflow, HTMLFormatter, CleanCSS, and W3C validators, 
and was put together with the goal of providing a comprehensive resource for MMA training, techniques, and gym schedule. 
The website is easy to navigate, visually appealing and fully responsive on mobile devices, and the logo was created using 
Freeform, which adds a professional touch to the website. The website is a valuable resource for anyone interested in MMA training, 
and it is an excellent representation of the gym's brand.
